The Binaries are available  in the BIN directory.

BIN/trc.exe

and

BIN/trctcl.exe

To Build:

First cd to the SOURCE directory and type 
           make all
           make trc
           
This will also make the library for TransNetCalc which building trctcl.exe will need.

Change directory to TCL.

Type:
   make
   
This will create trc.exe

Note we rename this to trctcl.exe in the BIN directory.

On MSYS2 execute using:

   winpty ./trctcl.exe
   
Also on MSYS2 make sure to place:
     tcl84.dll
     
where the executable resides.

The dll is also provided in the BIN directory.

By the way trc is for TRansmission line Calc.
