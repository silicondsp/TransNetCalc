There is an issue with the MSYS2 terminal when running executables.

The remedy to this problem is simple. 

To run an executable (trc.exe) we just type:

     winpty ./trc.exe
     
     or for TLC
     
     winpty ./trctcl.exe
     
     
Both executables are in the BIN directory.


     
We then get full interaction and support for TCL interpreter.

But first we must install winpty. Follow the instructions  below:



Grab the application (once):
 pacman -Sy winpty


Then always run trc.exe as follows:
    winpty ./trc.exe

That is winpty before trc. 

This is necessary since stdout writes to the console in MSYS inder Windows may not appear in interactive mode. 

winpty takes care of this. 

Also sometimes trc.exe may crash for no good reason  becuase of buffering on stdout and winpty takes care of this too.
