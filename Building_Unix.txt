To Build:

First cd to the SOURCE directory and type 
           make all
           make trc
           
This will also make the library for TransNetCalc which building trc in the TCL durectory also will need. 

Run:
./trc

By the way trc is for Transmission Line Calc.

To test,  load the topology doublestubtunerlumped.t
This is a double stub tuner that matches the load at 100 Ohms to 50 Ohms using coaxial cables.


To build with TCL interpreter buit in, follow the directions below:


For TCL Interprter support do the following:

run command 'pwd' in  the toplevel directory: TransmissionLineNets.

THE_PATH is this directory (obtained by pwd)
Next type
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=THE_PATH/library

Change directory to TCL.
type make
The executable is trc
Run:
./trc

Note you can now run tcl commands. See the documentation.
Also read the README.txt file in the TCL directory.



If  you need to build TCL8.4 we have included the source code in the directory: TCL8p4
