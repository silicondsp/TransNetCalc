Go to:
http://www.msys2.org/

and download msys2-x86_64_....

The 64 bit version.

Your home directory will be :
/usr/home/username

Which on a C drive is:

C:\msys64\home\username.

username is your Windows username.

You can override this by setting the HOME environmet variable to a different location. 

For compiling and linking  code you need to do the following:

1- Install gcc:
    pacman -Sy gcc
    
    If you get an error. Close window. Start msys 64 bit and use:
       pacman -Sy --force gcc
       
       
2- run:
          pacman -Sy mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain base-devel
       
       
3- Install perl:
    pacman -Sy perl
    
4- Java Installation:
    Java is required for plotting using the Open Source IIPPlot Java Application. 
    
    Installation is as follows:
    Install 64 bit Java JDK for Windows ( you can also just install the JRE but JDK allows for java application development).
    Using Windows Explorer find out where Java was installed. For example:
    
          C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_66\bin   
          
    Now this is a Windows type path. You need to add the Java bin path to MSYS2's PATH:
    
    So you would do the following in  the MSYS window.
    
          export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_66/bin
    
    Note the UNIX paths. Much better. Also the "\" escape of the space in "Program Files"
    
5-   Instead of updating the PATH every time, you can set it in the .bash_profiles directrory in your HOME directory
            so it will be updated when you start an MSYS2 terminal.
 
 
 
 6- Test java by typing "java". Also  test perl by typing "perl --version" at the terminal.
 
 7- install bison:
       pacman -Sy bison
    Bison is a bunch of tools ( e.g. yacc, awk etc). 
    
 8- Get a  graphical editor. We like TextPad . You can set Textxpad's exe in the PATH. Or JEDIT(Use Windows Install  EXE).
 
 9- Get vim the editor for UNIX . 
       pacman -Sy vim
 11- If you are used to vi set this alias in your .bash_profile file:   alias vi=vim
 
 12- Install make:
         pacman -Sy make
